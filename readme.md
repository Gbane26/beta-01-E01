If you have a question, do these in order:
 - Search in the example
 - Search in the documentation
 - Search online
 - keep looking *(~15 minutes is a good balance, less would show poor efforts, more you start to just being stubborn loose your time)*
 - Ask for help from any inhert object nearby
  ([rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging))
 - Ask your nearest peer
 - Ask another peer
 - Ask a seeder
 - Ask on discord
  ([don't ask to ask, just ask](http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html))

## TESTS

### `str`
export a string `str` with the value `"42"`

### `num`
export a number `num` with the value `42`

### `bool`
export a boolean `bool` with the value `false`

### `escapeStr`
export a string `escapeStr` containing the characters \\, /, ', ", and `

### `spaced key`
export a boolean `'spaced key'` with the value `true`

### `arr`
exports an array of two element:
 - a number with the value `4` at the index 0
 - a string with the value `'2'` at the index 1

### `fn`
export a function `fn` that takes one argument and return it

### `get`
export a function `get` that takes one argument, a string
and return the corresponding value

### `obj`
export an object `obj` that contains all the key / values from `module.exports`
but the spaced key, `obj.obj` should be a circular reference to itself

------

## BONUS

### `makeGet`
export a function `makeGet` that takes one argument and return a function that
takes no arguments but return the previously given argument

### `hideMe`
export a function `hideMe` that takes one object argument
and return a function that takes a string arguments and return the corresponding
values from the previously given object

### `safe`
export a function `safe` that takes no arguments
and return an object that contain two functions, `set`, `replace` and `get`.  
The function `set` take any value argument, store it and return generated key
The function `get` takes one of the generated key returned from `set`
and return the corresponding value
The function `replace` takes two arguments, a value and a generated key
and replace the value previously set for this key.
The generated keys must be empty object references generated by `Object.create(null)`

a function that takes a string arguments and return the corresponding
values from the previously given object
